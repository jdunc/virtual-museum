    brief: 'Basketmaker',
    description: `<p>Emma Garrett makes river cane baskets, the oldest basketry tradition among the Cherokee. Only a few women in the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians still make these beautiful baskets. She collects her own rivercane and dyes it with bloodroot or walnut. She also makes white oak baskets.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Snowbird, the Cherokee community in Graham County, Emma Garrett grew up watching her grandmother Molly Brown make baskets. In the Cherokee tradition, she observed and then "slipped off by herself to figure it out," she says.</p>

<p>Emma Garrett has demonstrated rivercane basketry at festivals in Atlanta, Chattanooga, and EmmalineMrs.MrSnowbird, and she also travels to powwows occasionally. Her baskets have won first place at the Cherokee Fall Fair. They are sold at the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual. Her work has been featured in the documentary video Cherokee Basketweavers. In addition to weaving baskets, Emma Garrett sings with a gospel trio from the Zion Hill Church in the Snowbird community.</p>
